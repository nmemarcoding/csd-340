        <p class="intro">My name is Nima Memarzadeh, and I grew up in Iran, where I was born and lived until I was 19 years old. 
        I've always loved exploring new interests and learning new things, which has led me to web development.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is going to the gym to stay fit and playing the guitar to relax and express creativity. 
        <span class="sentence">These activities keep me balanced and give me a sense of accomplishment.</span></p>

        <p>When I spend time with my family and friends, we enjoy talking and watching movies together. 
        Those moments bring us closer and help us create amazing memories.</p>

        <p>I became interested in coding and computers growing up next to my uncle, who is a computer scientist. 
        His passion for technology and problem-solving inspired me to explore coding and other computer-related topics.</p>
